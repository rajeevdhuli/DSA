The intuition behind this solution is based on the idea that the most efficient way to move between two points on a 2D grid is to take diagonal steps whenever possible. Let's break this down:

Key Observations:
Movement in 2D Grid:

In a 2D grid, you can move either:
Horizontally by 1 unit (left or right),
Vertically by 1 unit (up or down), or
Diagonally, which allows you to move both horizontally and vertically at the same time.
Optimal Moves:

When you move diagonally, you simultaneously reduce the horizontal and vertical distances by 1 unit each. This makes diagonal moves more efficient than moving only horizontally or vertically.
So, the optimal strategy is to move diagonally as much as possible until either the horizontal or vertical distance is zero. After that, you only need to move in the remaining direction (either horizontal or vertical).
Calculating Minimum Time:

Suppose you have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
The number of diagonal moves you can make is equal to the minimum of the absolute differences in the x and y coordinates: min(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|).
After using diagonal moves, you might have some remaining distance in either the horizontal or vertical direction. The total time is the larger of the two distances (whichever axis has more distance to cover).
Therefore, the total minimum time to move between two points is max(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|).
Intuition Recap:
Diagonal moves allow you to reduce both x and y distances simultaneously, so they are the most efficient moves.
Once you can no longer move diagonally, you'll just need to cover the remaining distance along one axis, which is the maximum of the horizontal or vertical distance between the points.
Thus, for each pair of consecutive points, the minimum time required is simply the maximum of the differences in x and y coordinates.

This approach ensures that you're always taking the shortest possible path between points, leading to the minimum total time.
