Let's break down how the code handles the case when the linked list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `k = 3`, which means we want to swap the 3rd node from the start with the 3rd node from the end.

### Steps of the Algorithm

1. **Initial List:**
   - Original List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`

2. **Calculate the Length of the List:**
   - `len = 6`

3. **Find the k-th Node from the Start (`cur1`):**
   - `k = 3`
   - `cur1` is the 3rd node from the start.
   - Traversal:
     - Start at `head` (1), move to 2 (2), move to 3 (3).
   - `cur1` points to node `3`.
   - `prev1` points to node `2` (node before `cur1`).

4. **Find the k-th Node from the End (`cur2`):**
   - `k = 3`
   - From the end: `len - k + 1 = 4` (4th node from the start)
   - `cur2` is the 4th node from the start.
   - Traversal:
     - Start at `head` (1), move to 2 (2), move to 3 (3), move to 4 (4).
   - `cur2` points to node `4`.
   - `prev2` points to node `3` (node before `cur2`).

5. **Swapping Nodes:**
   - Before swapping:
     - `cur1` points to `3`, and `cur2` points to `4`.
     - `prev1` points to `2`, and `prev2` points to `3`.
   - Update the next pointers:
     - Set `prev1.next` to `cur2` (2 now points to 4).
     - Set `prev2.next` to `cur1` (3 now points to 3).
     - Swap `cur1.next` and `cur2.next`:
       - `cur1.next` (originally pointing to 4) now points to `cur2.next` (5).
       - `cur2.next` (originally pointing to 5) now points to `cur1.next` (4).

6. **Resulting List After Swapping:**
   - `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6`

### Detailed Steps of Swapping

1. **Before Swap:**
   - List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`
   - `cur1` points to `3`, `cur2` points to `4`
   - `prev1` points to `2`, `prev2` points to `3`

2. **Update Pointers:**
   - `prev1.next` (which was `2 -> 3`) is updated to point to `cur2` (which is `4`):
     - Now `2 -> 4`.
   - `prev2.next` (which was `3 -> 4`) is updated to point to `cur1` (which is `3`):
     - Now `3 -> 3` (not changed).
   - Swap `cur1.next` and `cur2.next`:
     - `cur1.next` (originally `4 -> 5`) is set to `cur2.next` (which is `5`):
       - `3 -> 5`.
     - `cur2.next` (originally `5 -> 6`) is set to `cur1.next` (which is `4`):
       - `4 -> 3`.

3. **Final Swapped List:**
   - `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6`

### Summary
- **Swapped Nodes:** `3` and `4` are swapped with each other.
- **Adjacency:** Since nodes `3` and `4` are not adjacent, the code correctly updates their pointers without affecting the overall structure of the list.

The code correctly handles swapping nodes that are not adjacent by updating the previous nodesâ€™ pointers and swapping the `next` pointers of the nodes to be swapped.
